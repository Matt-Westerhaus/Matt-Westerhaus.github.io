				<p>
					This past summer I worked with a team of interns to create an open source Python library designed to help people with data preprocessing. 
					It relies on functionality from the already defined libraries Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit Learn and I also was able to familarize myself with 
					Keras and Tensorflow. The library that we made, named Soapi to reflect that it "cleans" data, holds functions to drop insignificant columns 
					and rows, fill in missing values if desired, transforming categorical values to numerical values to speed up machine learning model training 
					time along with a function to reverse this once the model is complete and many functions to gain information from your data.<br>  
					The link to the library can be found <a href="https://github.com/Soapi-Project/soapi" target="_blank">here</a>.

				<h1 class="projects_header"> Computer Graphics:</h1>
				<p>
					Working in teams, one project that we had in CISC 420, Computer Graphics, was to take models based on points in 3D space (on the x, y, and z axis) and to render them 
					in a way that aligned with how humans see objects in 3D space. For example, an object appears smaller as it becomes further away from one's point of view.
					To account for this we had to use many formulas that involved matrix multiplication. Originally this was used to calculate the model onto the screen but we further 
					applied this multiplication to determine how to present the object as if the user's point of view changed or if the model was rotating. Other difficulties of 
					this project included how to account for when the object was "trimmed" off the screen and not shown or also how to mathematically create a 3D shape. For example the 
					sphere was calculated simply off the centerpoint, the radius and how many points made up each ring. <br>

				<h1 class="projects_header"> Computer Architecture:</h1>
				<p> <br><br>
					On a team of two in CISC 340, Computer Architecture, one of the hardest projects of the semester was to take a basic CPU emulator (that we coded)
					and implement pipelining which is the act of having multiple processes of a larger function happening at once when specific resources were available 
					which meant that the function could be processing multiple commands at once and thereby increase efficiency. This in itself was hard enough but the 
					hardest part was learning to code in C which neither my partner or I had done before. This image is the README file of that project.
